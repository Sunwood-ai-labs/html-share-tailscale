description: Read requests the owner placed in HTML共有くん from a phone and start them on this computer. Use when the user says /inbox, $inbox, or asks to pick up phone requests.

# Inbox

Use the `html-share` CLI. The API is reachable only through the local loopback server and Tailscale; do not print private Tailnet URLs outside the user's request.

## 1. Read waiting requests

```bash
html-share review inbox
```

- `requests` are unfinished owner requests, oldest first
- `target` is a project nickname the owner typed on the phone. It may be `null`. Treat it as a hint, not a filesystem path
- If the array is empty, say there are no inbox requests and stop
- The computer does not need a separate pairing step. If the CLI cannot connect, confirm that the local server is running and Tailscale is connected.

## 2. Close every request you picked up, before starting

```bash
html-share review complete <id...>
```

- Close them all now. Do not wait until the work is done
- The inbox is a handover box, not a progress tracker. A request has no "in progress" state,
  so anything left open looks identical to a request no computer has picked up yet
- Closing is not abandoning. Report progress and results in chat as usual
- Finish what you picked up in this session. If something has to wait,
  say so in chat — it is no longer in the inbox to remind anyone
- Requests expire after 90 days, so do not leave them unread either

## 3. Identify the starting folder

Requests from a phone often belong to different projects. Do not start everything in the current working directory.

- Pull 1–3 distinctive words from the request text. If `target` is present, search for that nickname first
- Look in nearby README / AGENTS.md files. Do not keep a hardcoded map of nicknames to folders
- If the folder is the current working directory, start here
- If it is a different folder, start a new session there and tell the owner you did so
- If one request spans two places, start from the folder you will write to
- If you cannot tell, ask with 2–3 candidates. Do not guess from recency or a similar name

## 4. Start the work

Treat each request as a normal user instruction.

- If there is one request, start it without asking which to do first
- If there are several, list them in one line each with the folder you chose, then start from the oldest
- Still confirm before sending, publishing, deleting, or spending money
